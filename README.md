# byType
Sensible default typography for your projects by @davidpaulsson.

## How do I use this
This is a micro framework only to kick start you web projects typography. It does some pretty fancy pants stuff all thanks to SASS and Compass. It's *not* a full blown typography framework you can use and forget, it's meant to hack and make your own.

Stuff is pretty well commented, so digg in and make it your own.

[Here's a demo](http://bytype.davidpaulsson.se/).

## Why?
Because I've found myself doing this over, and over again. No more.
